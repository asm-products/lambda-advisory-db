title: haskell TLS 'tls-extra' Package SSL Certificate Validation Security Bypass Vulnerability
date: 2013-01-20
description: >
	The 'tls-extra' package for haskell TLS is prone to a security-bypass vulnerability because the application fails to properly 
	validate SSL certificates from the server. Successfully exploiting this issue allows attackers to perform man-in-the-middle 
	attacks or impersonate trusted servers, which will aid in further attacks. tls-extra versions prior to 0.6.1 are vulnerable.
patched_versions:
  - ">= 0.6.3"
